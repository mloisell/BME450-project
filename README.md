## Project description
This project will use a skin cancer dataset that contains 10015 different dermoscopic images. This includes physical skin surface images of skin cancer. The image dataset we will use is MNIST: HAM10000 found on kaggle. The goal of this project is to train a neural network to identify the types of skin cancers such as basal cell carcinoma, benign keratosis-like lesions, dermatofibroma, melanoma, melanocytic nevi, angiokeratomas, pyogenic granulomas and more. Our first step in the project will be to download and go through the data set. We will choose 3-5 classes of skin cancer types that are distinct from each other as proof of concept. Our final project goal is to complicate the model by testing a larger variety of skin cancer types that look more similar.
